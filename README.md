Hello and welcome! This website is a real project designed to solve a real problem. I noticed that many people struggle to track the books they've read and want to read, so I created this website to help with that.

The best part? It works with local storage, meaning users don't need to create an account. This eliminates the common barrier of sign-ups, making it easier for everyone to use.

You can see a preview of how the website looks in this video (please note that it's not yet deployed):
